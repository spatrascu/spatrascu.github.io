### CPSC 120

* Sandwich([Lab 8, Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-ashton-stefan.git)) 

  Lab 8, part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn how to properly use the command line. I also really like sandwiches, so it was      cool that I was able to customize my own sandwich by inputing different condiments and bread. I think this lab was important because I     
  learned how to use the command line, and use the different arguments on the command line.

* Schedule([Lab 9, Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-09-stefan.git))

  Lab 9, Part 2 was very fun for me because I liked how I had to compare the schedules of two philosphers. It felt like the code had a 
  realistic application in the real world. I think it was an important lab because I learned how to compare two strings and iterate through 
  each character of a string indivually.  

* Counties ([Lab 10, Part 2](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-10-stefan-and-alan.git))

  Lab 10, part 2 was one of my favorites because I liked how I was able to practice using 2d arrays and sorting and matching the different 
  counties and population. It was also a slightly challenging lab so I had fun because I considered it a challenge. This lab was important 
  because it taught me about 2d arrays.
